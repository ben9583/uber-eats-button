      <p>WiFi credentials have been saved. The button will now try connecting to the network and this access point should disappear if everything is working. If the button still hasn't connected, please make sure it is in range of the WiFi network. You can also visit the previous page again to enter new credentials if the button is still showing as an access point.</p>
